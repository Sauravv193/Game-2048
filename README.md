2048 Game

Tile Merging: When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a single tile with the sum of their values.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of your score as you merge tiles.
Responsive Design: The game is responsive and can be played on different screen sizes.
Reset Functionality: You can restart the game at any time to play again.

Technologies Used:
